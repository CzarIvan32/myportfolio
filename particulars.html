                  This was my 1st and one of the biggest projects I worked for.
                  I have made Identification Cards for all government employees
                  in all barangays under the Municipality of Surallah. Although
                  I do not have the proof, but sure is I have done this work as
                  my legacy, some employees do remember me when I visit their
                  respective offices. That was around 800+ IDs issued within 2
                  weeks.
